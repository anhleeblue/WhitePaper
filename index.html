                                We have a strong emphasis on providing
                                community service which is characterized by
                                self-sustainability and development. Cosplayers
                                have various motivations for their activity, some
                                Cosplayer want to become professional, others
                                want more fans, and yet others are looking to
                                share their work with groups. Photographers and
                                Props Makers working closely with Cosplayers
                                also have some influence on the increasing
                                diversity of motivations. The enthusiasm of
                                fans who support them are also on the rise, and
                                Cosplay Economy is attracting attention as a
                                market. 
                                <p>However, regardless whether in Japan or
                                        overseas, cosplayers, photographers, prop
                                        makers and users alike have challenges and
                                        roadblocks. For the sustainable development
                                        of the Cosplay economy, we need measures to
                                        meet and resolve them.</p>

                           <p>The cosplay industry has exploded open over
                                the last ten years, and while most players take
                                part for their own enjoyment, many spend great
                                amounts of money participating. </p>
                            <p>According to China Research and Intelligence
                                    (CRI),the estimated amount spent on costumes
                                    and wigs in 2017 was 17.8 billion USD (including
                                    cosmetics and fabrics to create outfits). However,
                                    this amount is expected to be far greater when
                                    you consider the additional costs involved, such
                                    as event tickets, photography fees, travel and
                                    accommodation, plus many other expenses.
                                    On top of this, according to Eventbrite, 59% of
                                    attendees will spend a further $100-$500 on
                                    merchandise at events, with 10% spending over
                                    $500 per show.</p>
