                                self-sustainability and development. Cosplayers
                                have various motivations for their activity, some
                                Cosplayer want to become professional, others
                                want more fans, and yet others are looking to
                                share their work with groups. Photographers and
                                Props Makers working closely with Cosplayers
                                also have some influence on the increasing
                                diversity of motivations. The enthusiasm of
                                fans who support them are also on the rise, and
                                Cosplay Economy is attracting attention as a
                                market.

                                        overseas, cosplayers, photographers, prop
                                        makers and users alike have challenges and
                                        roadblocks. For the sustainable development
                                        of the Cosplay economy, we need measures to

                            <p>According to China Research and Intelligence
                                    (CRI),the estimated amount spent on costumes
                                    and wigs in 2017 was 17.8 billion USD (including
                                    cosmetics and fabrics to create outfits). However,
                                    this amount is expected to be far greater when
                                    you consider the additional costs involved, such
                                    as event tickets, photography fees, travel and
                                    accommodation, plus many other expenses.
                                    On top of this, according to Eventbrite, 59% of
                                    attendees will spend a further $100-$500 on
                                    merchandise at events, with 10% spending over
                                    $500 per show.</p>

                                we have isolated five key issues facing cosplay as a whole:

                                    Many cosplayers are not paid for their work because
                                    they do not have access to a settlement account to
                                    receive funds. In addition, many young players and
                                    users do not own a credit card. Although PayPal is
                                    an option, it is not commonly recognised and it has
                                    miscellaneous fees on top of bank transaction fees.
                                    Other transaction methods such as micropayments
                                    and currency exchange are risky and inconvenient.

                                    Due to the nature of cosplay, players can be
exposed to a large number of followers and often
we find that players get harassed. The recent
“Cosplay Is Not Consent’ movement has shed light
to the harassment that cosplayers face within the
cosplay community.
Other cosplay platforms rely solely on SNS followers
as a trigger to feature cosplayers. This method lacks
transparency and opens the door to unwanted
attention, leading to harassment and unfulfilled
services.

                <p>COT is an ERC20-standard token that will be distributed as part of the TGE and ICO. This will be the only
                        token sold during the ICO. Following the crowdsale, COT can be stored in any ERC20-compliant wallet.
                        Additional functionality will be introduced in the future:</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>Player Coins are not a single coin, rather an
                            umbrella term that covers all personalized,
                            individual Player Coins. Individual Player Coins
                            will have different tickers of the format __COT,
                            where __ can be any combination of 2 or 3 letters
                            dependent on the issuer. An example of this would
                            be Kazumi Noomi issuing KNCOT. There is no limit
                            to how many different Player Coins are in existence,
                            and Players on the platform may issue a Player Coin
                            freely. As such, at any point in time there will be
                            many, varying Player Coins active in the ecosystem
                            with both high and low values.</p>
                        <p>Player Coins are classified as Smart Tokens. In
                            addition to standard ERC20 code, Smart Tokens
                            have further logic in place that allows them to
                            interact in different ways.</p>
                        <p>Utilising this extra code, Player Coins have:</p>

                        <h2>Issuing a Player Coin</h2>
                        <p>To issue a Player Coin, the Player must provide a
                            reserve amount of COT tokens to a dedicated smart
                            contract. This is called the initial COT Reserve Fund,
                            and is instrumental in calculating the price and
                            therefore volatility of the Player Coin. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A Fixed Reserve Ratio governs the amount of COT
                            in the COT Reserve Fund compared to the Player
                            Coin’s Total Value, or Marketcap:

                        </div>
                        <p>The recommended Fixed Reserve Ratio for Player
                            Coins is 0.01 - 0.05, or 1% - 5%. A value of 3% has
                            been found to provide the best balance between
                            liquidity and price volatility in most cases. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Once a Player Coin has been created, anyone can
                            send COT into the Smart Contract to effectively
                            ‘buy’ the Player Coin at any time. The contract
                            will mint new Player Coins to maintain the Fixed
                            Reserve Ratio between the now higher amount of
                            COT in the COT Reserve Fund and the Total Player
                            Coin Supply. Player Coins may also be sent back
                            into the contract in return for COT, effectively
                            ‘selling’ the Player Coin and reducing the COT in the
                            COT Reserve Fund.</p>

                <p>The price of a Player Coin is based on a the current supply and Fixed Reserve Ratio. Equations (1) and
                    (2) (above) can be combined and rearranged to form a relationship between Player Coin Price, the COT
                    Reserve Fund, the Total Player Coin Supply, and the Fixed Reserve Ratio:</p>
                <div class="img_13">
                        <img src="image/3_13.png" width="100%"alt="">                            
                </div>
                <p>This allows the Player Coin Price to vary as more Player Coins are: </p>
                <div class="span_13">
                    <p><span>.</span>Bought (COT Reserve Fund and Total Player Coin Supply both increase) </p>
                    <p><span>.</span>Sold (COT Reserve Fund and Total Player Coin Supply both decrease) </p>                
                </div>
                <p>As the Total Player Coin Supply is a function of the COT Reserve Fund, this price can be modelled against
                    the Total Player Coin Supply for differing Fixed Reserve Ratio values. 
                </p>
                <p>However, this price is calculated based on a single point in time. As a simplified example, if a user was to
                    purchase 10 tokens, the token price would increase 10 times as each token was bought. Using the above
                    equations millions of times per transaction to approximate each individual price-point is wasteful and
                    imprecise. Further price calculations are therefore necessary. 
                </p>
                <p>The following integral equation is used to calculate the end amount of Player Coins received based on the
                    amount of COT Paid and infinitely many changes in price over the course of the transaction. </p>
