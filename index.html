                                self-sustainability and development. Cosplayers
                                have various motivations for their activity, some
                                Cosplayer want to become professional, others
                                want more fans, and yet others are looking to
                                share their work with groups. Photographers and
                                Props Makers working closely with Cosplayers
                                also have some influence on the increasing
                                diversity of motivations. The enthusiasm of
                                fans who support them are also on the rise, and
                                Cosplay Economy is attracting attention as a
                                market.

                                        overseas, cosplayers, photographers, prop
                                        makers and users alike have challenges and
                                        roadblocks. For the sustainable development
                                        of the Cosplay economy, we need measures to

                            <p>According to China Research and Intelligence
                                    (CRI),the estimated amount spent on costumes
                                    and wigs in 2017 was 17.8 billion USD (including
                                    cosmetics and fabrics to create outfits). However,
                                    this amount is expected to be far greater when
                                    you consider the additional costs involved, such
                                    as event tickets, photography fees, travel and
                                    accommodation, plus many other expenses.
                                    On top of this, according to Eventbrite, 59% of
                                    attendees will spend a further $100-$500 on
                                    merchandise at events, with 10% spending over
                                    $500 per show.</p>

                                we have isolated five key issues facing cosplay as a whole:

                                    Many cosplayers are not paid for their work because
                                    they do not have access to a settlement account to
                                    receive funds. In addition, many young players and
                                    users do not own a credit card. Although PayPal is
                                    an option, it is not commonly recognised and it has
                                    miscellaneous fees on top of bank transaction fees.
                                    Other transaction methods such as micropayments
                                    and currency exchange are risky and inconvenient.

                                    Due to the nature of cosplay, players can be
exposed to a large number of followers and often
we find that players get harassed. The recent
“Cosplay Is Not Consent’ movement has shed light
to the harassment that cosplayers face within the
cosplay community.
Other cosplay platforms rely solely on SNS followers
as a trigger to feature cosplayers. This method lacks
transparency and opens the door to unwanted
attention, leading to harassment and unfulfilled
services.
